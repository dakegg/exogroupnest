Powershell Script to report on Group Nesting in Exchange Online Distribution Groups

The script assumes youâ€™ve made a connection to Exchange Online powershell, so be sure to add the appropriate commands to the top of the script to make a remote Psh connection to EXO or invoke the Exchange Online V2 module.

Running the command will produce a graphical tree-view of your groups and their nested groups.
